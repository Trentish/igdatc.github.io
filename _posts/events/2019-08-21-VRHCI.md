#### Valve Index - Alex Carlson
Valve Index is a new VR headset, controllers, and tracking Base Stations that extend technology first seen in the HTC Vive in completely new ways.

My talk will cover:

* Index headset displays, optics, audio, and ergonomics
* Some of the better mods for the headset Frunk
* Index contollers in practice, capabilities, and backwards compatability
* Quick overview of the generic SteamVR Skeletal Input API
* (NOT Lighthouse 2.0, but I encourage others to share.)

Alex Carlson is a game developer from Minneapolis, MN. Currently working at Target Headquarters on the Creative AR/VR team. He's also working on a game about a dog that rides a skateboard, it's called Ollie-Oop. [http://skateboarding.dog/](http://skateboarding.dog/)

#### Vive Focus Plus, SideQuest - RJ White
The HTC Vive Focus Plus is a 6-DOF standalone VR headset designed for enterprise use. I'll cover technical capabilities vs Oculus Quest, and what I've learned while porting projects to Focus.

SideQuest, the community-led project for simplifying "sideloading" for the Oculus Quest, continues to evolve, and now has features for distributing WIP/demo apps to Quest users. I'll share a quick history of SideQuest, and my experience distributing Hardlight Blade.

I'm RJ White, and I'm a VR developer at Ghost Productions. I live in Centerville, MN with my wife and three children. I previously released Hardlight Blade for the Oculus Go, Rift, and Quest (via SideQuest), and FireZone for the Oculus Go. I'm currently working on Animov, a multiplayer sci-fi shooter for mobile VR and LBE experiences. Check out my twitter for my personal VR work: [@RJdoesVR](https://twitter.com/rjdoesvr)
