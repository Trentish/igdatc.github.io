Plug-in free (read: without Flash) web browser video game development with HTML5 and JavaScript has matured, and is here to stay.  In this quick overview of the current landscape, I will cover the technology available today and what is on the horizon.  I will also demo some games, discuss engines and libraries, and serve a big dose of reality about desktop browser vs mobile browser performance.

Zachary Johnson is a Creative Developer from Minneapolis specializing in web applications and home brew video games.  He is currently publishing his own work, extending his network, and accepting consulting gigs on [www.zachstronaut.com](http://www.zachstronaut.com).

We're in the Nerdery's new theater.  Don't use the main enterance. Enter on the west side, and head straight back.

We're also hosting an all day E3 viewing / social event at the Chatterbox 6/6.
