#### OC6 Highlights and Other News - Matt Summers, Zach Wendt, and you

We'll cover our favorite talks, demos, and news from Oculus Connect 6, and the co-located Nreal event.  This will be a roundtable discussion, and we encourage everyone to share - if you attended or not.  We'd also like to briefly cover Vive Cosmos, Beat On, The Void and any other important news you've read about.

#### Sun Shard WIP - RJ White

My latest project is a physics-based melee combat game for the Oculus Quest, called [Sun Shard](https://twitter.com/RJdoesVR/status/1175781271957647361). I'll share some progress shots, talk about relying on physics in a VR game, and chat about my experiences using SideQuest for public alpha testing.

I'm RJ White, and I'm a VR developer at Ghost Productions. I live in Centerville, MN with my wife and three children. I previously released Hardlight Blade for the Oculus Go, Rift, and Quest (via SideQuest), and FireZone for the Oculus Go. I'm currently working on Animov, a multiplayer sci-fi shooter for mobile VR, and Sun Shard. Check out my twitter for my personal VR work: [@RJdoesVR](https://twitter.com/rjdoesvr)

#### Aligning, Overlapping and Abusing Quest Playspaces - Zach Wendt

Standard Quest playspaces can be bigger than a 2 car garage, and set up in seconds.  But since day 1, I've been testing larger areas indoors and [outdoors](https://twitter.com/zach_wendt/status/1131745505288048641), and testing various methods to align playspaces between sessions and multiple headsets. I don't have significant content/project using this. I'm just sharing techniques and hoping to inspire others.
