Paul Metcalf dives into self-motivation, leading developments on Tactics V: “Obsidian Brigade” on the side of a 40-hour day job for 3 years.

Paul Metcalf is a founding partner for From Nothing Game Studios here in the Twin Cities. He draws major inspiration from 90s tactical RPGs of his youth, and has a history of tabletop wargaming. Previously programing 4 gridded combat systems without releasing them, the 5th system used in Tactics V (hence the V) shows his research as it is their most ambitious title yet.
