<p>Multiplayer Extravaganza is an ongoing series of monthly events where our community gets together to play games and share gaming experiences. The games we play and discuss include a rotating collection of favorites suggested by the community as well as locally made games that local game makers bring to the events.  Come share your passion for games, or bring your own game to get feedback and encouragement, or simply join us to find your place in the gaming world.  There's always something new to discover! Read about <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/category/events/multiplayer/">past and future Multiplayer Extravaganza events</a> on our blog.</p>
<h3>AttendÂ Multiplayer Extravaganza</h3>
<p>The dates and locations of future <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/category/events/multiplayer/">Multiplayer Extravaganza events</a> will be announced on our blog.  It is also recommended that you join the IGDATC <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/igda-tc">Google Group</a> or follow us on either <a href="http://www.twitter.com/igdatc">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/IGDATC">Facebook</a>.</p>
<h3>Call for Local Games</h3>
<p>Are you a local game maker?  All locally made games are welcome at Multiplayer Extravaganza, including board games, single player games, mobile games, etc.  We encourage demos and works-in-progress. We want the events to help local game creators refine their games, get exposure, and gain valuable feedback.</p>
<p>One of the big screens at the event will be dedicated to locally made games, but you are welcome to present your game in other ways as well.  We will split time on the local screen evenly and fairly between the game makers in attendance.  Sign up for this screen will be on Eventbrite prior to the event.  If you'd like to see your game on this screen, we recommend bringing your own laptop to plug into this screen directly.  This is the best way to ensure your game works.  If that is not possible, contact us at <a href="mailto:events@igdatc.org">events@igdatc.org</a> and we will test your game on our hardware.</p>
