<p>The IGDATC Monthly Meetings are our "main event" and an excellent place to meet local game makers and learn new things. We generally have two presentations at each meeting covering game industry topics such as design, programming, marketing, art, audio, and everything in between. In addition to our main speaker, we have a shorter "member project" presentation that is great for first time speakers! Our events also open with announcements and an opportunity for you to pitch your latest project in front of the audience. At the end of the night, we head over to a local bar for more socializing.</p>
<h3>Attend Monthly Meetings</h3>
<p>We typically meet starting at 6:00pm every month on the second Wednesday at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/9555+James+Ave+S+%23245/@44.8310696,-93.3005977,17z/">Nerdery</a> in the south metro. These events are free and open to the public, but require registration to attend. We always try and post dates and locations of future events on our blog, but you can also check <a href="https://igdatc.eventbrite.com/">our Eventbrite</a> for the latest event listings.</p>
<p>It is also recommended that you join the IGDATC <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/igda-tc">Google Group</a> or follow us on either <a href="http://www.twitter.com/igdatc">Twitter</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/IGDATC">Facebook</a>.</p>
<h3>Call for Speakers</h3>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>IGDA Twin Cities has been hosting meetings for local game developers since 2004!</p>
<p>Beginning around 2011, we began posting our events as blog posts <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/category/events/">here on the website</a>. Sometime after that we switched to mostly posting them on <a href="http://igdatc.eventbrite.com/">Eventbrite</a>. We do also host <a href="http://www.igdatc.org/history/">a page with a list of our events before 2011</a>.</p>
<h3>Feedback / Contact Us</h3>
