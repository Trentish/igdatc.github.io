<p>At July's Mixer we continued hosting the Local Game Screen on a big screen, dedicated to locally made games. The Local Game Screen is an awesome opportunity for us to share feedback and encouragement with our fellow game makers.</p>
<p>We had seven games shared by seven local game makers, with most featured on the Local Game Screen itself and with additional mobile games and even a board game prototype being showcased nearby.</p>
